# UTSA-Emerging-Technology-Partnership-Internship-Slack-Bot

Sara McDonald coded this Slack bot with GitHub Copilot's assistance for the Emerging Technology Partnership Internship at the University of Texas at San Antonio. The purpose of the project was to document how Copilot could be used to code a bot with an API the programmer is not familiar with.

To run this code, you need to setup a Slack App with two slash commands: /add-task and /list-tasks. The app should have the chat:write, chat:write:customize, commands, reactions:read, and channels:history scopes.

The bot Authentication Token and Signing Secret should be saved in an .env file.
